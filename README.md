In my front-end project, I developed a platform using HTML, CSS (enhanced with Bootstrap), and JavaScript for accessing current affairs from 10 different countries. Leveraging React, I utilized modern development practices including functional components, hooks (like useState and useEffect for state management and side effects), routing for seamless navigation across pages, and props for passing data between components. This setup allowed for a dynamic user experience, where users can easily browse and stay updated with news from various nations. The project integrates responsive design principles ensuring accessibility across devices, making it user-friendly and adaptable.
